        <div class="subheading mb-5">History</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently in my fourth year at UC Riverside as a history major. I transferred to UC Riverside after completing my Associate's degree in both History and Social Science.
        After graduation from UC Riverside, I will continue to a graduate program and California Baptist University to earn a master's degree in Education and a teaching credential. After my educational journey,
        I hope to become a high school history teacher at one of the local high schools. My hope is to inspire young minds to look at history with an inquisitve mind and to find value in lessons that our society has
        and continues to learn. History shapes our lives in many ways and the earlier students can understand the importance of our past, I believe, the better.<br><br>

        In addition to being a full time student, I am also a mother of two young children. I have one child who is eleven and is beginning the exciting, yet terrifying journey of becoming a teenager. I hope to help
        guide her, as much as she will allow, and build a strong familial foundation in her life. My son is five. He has just started his educational journey and is currentyl excited about all new things he gets to
        learn about. I hope that I can help him keep his love of knowledge and to continue to pursue it in higher education when the tim comes. Both of my children play sports and learn about how to work as a team with
        other children. As a child, I also played sports and feel that this experience has helped to shape my collaborative spirit. Sports are a great precursor to the team building that is needed within life, both
        personally and in work evironments.<br><br>

        On a more relaxed note, when I have a moment to myself, I enjoy reading. I naturally gravitate towards fiction, but also dabble with nonfiction. My favorite genres are fantast, murder mystery, and psychological thrillers.
        I also like to read and watch documentaries about true crime. Within the true crime genre, my interests range from crime solving shows to learning about various cults. On my commute to and from school, I am usually listening
        a podcast about such topics. My favorite true crime book is Unmasked by Paul Holes and my favorite podcast is My Favorite Murder. While these topics has made me more cautious and aware of the dangers of the world, I cannot seem
        to stop my consumption of them. I am like a moth to a light, I keep coming back for more of true crime. My sister is also interested in these topics, which makes it more enjoyable when we get to sit and talk about all that we have
        learned and listened to recently. Aside from true crime, I also enjoy watching or listening to documentaries about history, specifically any war that the United States has been apart of. I am currently watching a documentary about
        World War II that had been adapted with color. For some reason, adding the colors of the world into the documentary make the events seem more real and not so long ago. I also find the colonial period of America especially interesting
        and have watch and read many accounts of that time period. I feel that my tastes range all over the place, but that just leaves room for acquiring much information.
